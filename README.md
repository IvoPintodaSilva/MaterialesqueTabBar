# Material-like animatable Tab Bar implementation

Iteration #1: This is a mini-project to deliver an animated material-like tab bar library that anyone can add to their app.
It is still a work in progress.

Iteration #2: Tabs are done and selection is animated. The next goal is to animate the indicator between the different tabs and not have one indicator on each tab.

Iteration #3: Tab indicator animating as desired. Next steps involve adding customizability, integrating the ViewControllers and improving the TabBar overall aspect.

The current state of the project:
