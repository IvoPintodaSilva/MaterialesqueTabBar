# Material-like animatable Tab Bar implementation

This is a mini-project to deliver an animated material-like tab bar library that anyone can add to their app.
It is still a work in progress.

Tabs are done and selection is animated. The next goal is to animate the indicator between the different tabs and not have one indicator on each tab. 

The current state of the project:
